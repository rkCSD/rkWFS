[Setup (German)](https://wiki.reneknipschild.net/comp:www:setuprkwfs)

### Base Installation

  * Rename **config.sample.php** to **config.php**
  * Set **WEBSITE_DEFAULT_URI** to the default URI
  * Add or remove Projects in **WFS_PROJECTS**

### Extended configuration

It's possible to set some other configurations in **config.php**:

  * **UPLOAD_FOLDER**: Specifies the place for all projects
  * **TEMP_FOLDER**: Needed for ZIP-Files. The webserver need access to it!
  * **ZIP_METHOD**: Can be __BUILD_IN__ (PHP's ZIPArchive, might be slow because compression cannot be disabled) or __LINUX_EXT__ (if the webserver runs under Linux, native zip-function will be used)
  * **MAX_ZIP_AGE**: Time, how long a autogenerated ZIP-Archive should exist
